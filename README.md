# Last.fm Manual Scrobbler

A simple Python script to manually upload missing listening data to Last.fm from a CSV file. This is useful for filling data gaps when your scrobbler application fails to work for a period of time.

## üìù Prerequisites

* A Last.fm account.
* **Python 3.6** or later installed on your system.
* **Git** installed on your system.
* A CSV file containing your listening history. This script is designed to work with files generated by tools like Pano Scrobbler.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Before using the script, you need to get the necessary API credentials from Last.fm and generate a password hash.

### 1. Get Your Last.fm API Key and Secret

1.  Go to the [Last.fm API Account page](https://www.last.fm/api/account).
2.  Log in with your Last.fm username and password.
3.  Click on **"Create an account"** and create a new application. The details can be anything you choose.
4.  Once created, you will be given an **API Key** and an **API Secret**. Keep these handy.

### 2. Generate Your Password Hash

The script requires an MD5 hash of your password for authentication. You can generate this easily using Python.

1.  Open a terminal and run `python3`.
2.  At the Python prompt, paste the following code, replacing `"your_password_here"` with your actual Last.fm password:

```python
import hashlib
password = "your_password_here"
password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
print(password_hash)
